**Study on Secondary Structure and Mechanical Properties of Silk Proteins**<p align="right">**Hangzhou, China**</p>

**Researcher (Lead)** <p align="right">**Mar.2023-Ongoing**</p>

**‘Chu Kochen’ College Natural Science Fund Student Cultivation Project**

Project Description: Protein modeling, molecular dynamic simulation and analysis

- The evolution of β-folded domain and amorphous domain of silk protein microstructure under tensile and shear deformation
- The interaction between silk proteins and different solvents and the changes of the structure and mechanical properties of silk proteins under the action of different solvents
- The interaction between the microstructure of silk protein and low-dimensional nanomaterials - try to understand the failure mechanism of the interface between silk protein and low-dimensional nanomaterials under mechanical loading.
