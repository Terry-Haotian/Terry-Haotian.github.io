I am a third-year undergraduate at Zhejiang University, majoring mechanics. My interests lie in **biomechanics, OCE(Optical Coherence Elastography) and the field of combining optics and mechanics.**

I am now looking for opportunities to work on cornea mechanical property detection though OCE or ohter optical technologies. Feel free to reach out to me through email.
